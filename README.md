# Invisibility Cloak Fun Project

## Library Used
- OpenCV

# For creating your own cloak at your home follow the steps after cloning the repository-

- Open the file named 'invisibility cloak using opencv' 
- Capture the background of your room and then use it the file 'cloak'.
- Find the RGB value of the color you want to make invisible, I choose red because I had a plain red cloth .
- Both file has comments to make things clear and read the opencv documentation for more details.
